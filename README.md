# Minesweeper Board Generator for Discord
This program can generate a simple minesweeper board for use in Discord. It makes use of spoiler tags as a way to simulate playing minesweeper while within a text channel.

Standard used: `C++17`.

## Usage
Compile the program by using `make` on the command line.

Then, run the program `minesweeper_boardgen`. This will output a file called `minesweeper.txt` where you can copy and paste its contents into a text channel.

## Miscellaneous
This program was a fun little side project that was done in approximately less than an hour. Mind the errors.
